# GameOfTomes
A small terminal game I created! It's a story, walk through it and interact with it!

The Tome King is the king of knowledge, and he has been studying all his life. He put everything into THE GOLDEN TOME! 

It was stolen! Follow the Tome King through this interactive story to find out who stole the tome, why, and battle villians to uncover the truth. 

Including mini games, (hopefully) likeable characters, and an odd adventure for knowledge!
